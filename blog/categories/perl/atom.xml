    <id>https://xaerxess.pl/blog/2014/03/12/how-i-hijacked-a-cpan-module</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today Neil Bowers (<a href="https://twitter.com/neilbowers/">@neilbowers</a>) wrote a blog post titled <a href="http://neilb.org/2014/03/11/uploading-01.html">&ldquo;What happens when you upload to CPAN?&rdquo;</a> &ndash; a sneak peek at the very last part of module releasing process (when you do <code>cpan-upload</code> and recieve these two strange emails). Although I&rsquo;ve already released few distributions, <a href="https://pause.perl.org">PAUSE</a> still seems to me as a mysterious tool with design (i.e. web interface) from previous epoch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but somehow capable of managing over 29000 distributions maintained by over 11000 authors. <!-- more -->What intrigued me in Neil&rsquo;s article was the &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; part (namespace indexer), particularly a conclusion (<em>&ldquo;the permissions check should be separate from, and earlier than, the indexing stage&rdquo;</em>) and these three points:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>PAUSE checks each package in your release to see if you&rsquo;re allowed to release it. You must either be the owner or have co-maint (see the doc for PAUSE::Permissions). If you&rsquo;ve flagged the package with no_index in the metadata, then the check is skipped.</li>
<li>You are given ownership (&lsquo;f&rsquo; permission) for any packages that don&rsquo;t currently have any permission associated with them in PAUSE.</li>
<li>The second email is sent to you, with the results of the permissions check.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What wasn&rsquo;t clear to me was whether PAUSE let me do an &ldquo;unauthorized release&rdquo; of a module which doesn&rsquo;t have any owner listed in <code>06perms.txt</code>. To find out, I wrote a simple script which found modules without owner (using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PAUSE::Permissions"><code>PAUSE::Permissions</code></a>) and then checked which of these are existing distributions (using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Source"><code>CPAN::Source</code></a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p>As a result I had a list containing few &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; distributions, from which I chose one: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/MOCONNOR/YAML-AppConfig-0.16/lib/YAML/AppConfig.pm"><code>YAML::AppConfig</code></a> &ndash; previously released in 2006, with few bugs on RT. I made two <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/YAML-AppConfig/commit/3bd3da22af39df848eebf6db69ab2e7e200c82c9">small</a> <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/YAML-AppConfig/commit/2e618883a9bfe464f547509fcfed6487b2a1cd84">fixes</a>, bumped version to 0.17, made gzipped dist file and uploaded it to CPAN. I was expecting I&rsquo;d receive two emails from PAUSE, the second informing me that distribution wasn&rsquo;t indexed due to insufficient permissions. To my astonishment, I actually got <em>&ldquo;Status of this distro: OK&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Status: Successfully indexed&rdquo;</em>, and after few hours every piece of Perl / CPAN / PAUSE ecosystem listed my release as <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::AppConfig">proper one</a>. I&rsquo;ve checked <code>06perms.txt</code> and found:</p>

<pre><code>YAML::AppConfig,MOCONNOR,c
YAML::AppConfig,XAERXESS,f
</code></pre>

<p>PAUSE gave me &lsquo;f&rsquo; permission, which I thought are given only to <strong>original</strong> distribution author. According to one of last Perl Advent Calendar articles covering <a href="http://perladvent.org/2013/2013-12-08.html">PAUSE permissions model</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The &lsquo;f&rsquo; permission (&lsquo;first come&rsquo;) says that I was the <strong>first person</strong> to upload the module.</p></blockquote>

<p>&hellip;who <strong>I</strong> wasn&rsquo;t. At this point I closed a bug on RT, and started tweaking <code>YAML::AppConfig</code>, which, although &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo;, I consider suitable for my <a href="https://questhub.io/realm/perl/quest/530a823b6e7817b05100001a">Monthly New Distribution Challenge 2014</a>.</p>

<p>To sum up, either my understanding of PAUSE permissions is wrong or they have some flaws (or maybe features?). If I&rsquo;m wrong, please correct me.</p>

<p>Anyway, does module hijacking counts as a module adoption?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Follow-up</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to disclose potential security threat, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be more careful in the future writing about similar issues. Luckily, as you can see <a href="/blog/2014/03/12/how-i-hijacked-a-cpan-module.html#comment-1283194094">in the comment</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rjbs">@rjbs</a> was in the right place in the right time (i.e. <a href="http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2014/">Perl QA Hackaton 2014</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/commit/d3e76f314c33570b2670b07eb7c2a93ccfcec66a">fixed the bug</a> in PAUSE.</p>

<p>To be honest, I looked at PAUSE code after I had &ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; module, but setting up PAUSE is <a href="https://twitter.com/rjbs/status/444185178811146240">&ldquo;Very Hard™&rdquo;</a>. For example, I didn&rsquo;t have any <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/blob/66f72204e24957415f5d2aca3fba519661beb2d8/doc/README#L142">Apache 1.3 with mod_perl1</a> ready at hand, nor any spare time to compile it. Hope it&rsquo;ll be easier in the future.</p>

<p>One more thing &ndash; I took the opportunity and &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; <code>YAML::AppConfig</code>: fixed all bugs, made all tests pass, added changelog, modernized its metadata, and uploaded version 0.19 on CPAN. If you spot more bugs (either in PAUSE or <code>YAML::AppConfig</code>), please report them. It&rsquo;s open source after all.</p>

<p>I had to fix <code>CPAN::Source</code> first; I&rsquo;ll try to publish fixes for it later, because actually it&rsquo;s a nice tool with 100% test failed on CPAN Testers.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <id>https://xaerxess.pl/blog/2014/02/28/using-extutils-makemaker-for-my-first-co-maint-release-bloom-filter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After over 7 years, a new release of <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/XAERXESS/Bloom-Filter-1.1"><code>Bloom::Filter</code></a> is out! Thanks to Maciej Ceglowski (<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MCEGLOWS">MCEGLOWS</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/baconmeteor">@baconmeteor</a>), who was kind enough to give me co-maint permissions. If you don&rsquo;t know what bloom filter is<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, please read <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/04/08/bloom_filters.html">&ldquo;Using Bloom Filters&rdquo;</a> (article written by Maciej in 2004, but still up-to-date and very interesting). Instead of writing about bloom filters, in this blog post I&rsquo;d like to concentrate on Perl module release process, as a part of my personal &ldquo;diving into Perl&rdquo; process.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, just a quick summary what&rsquo;s included new version of <code>Bloom::Filter</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Status=Resolved;Queue=Bloom-Filter">two bug reports closed</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>links to <a href="github.com/Xaerxess/Bloom-Filter">GitHub repository</a></li>
<li>updated revision history in <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/XAERXESS/Bloom-Filter-1.1/Changes">Changes</a> (as per <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Changes::Spec"><code>CPAN::Changes::Spec</code></a>)</li>
<li>cleaned documentation</li>
<li>tweaked Makefile.PL</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see &ndash; only minor changes, no new features or optimizations. Still, it was hard for me to deal with &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; distibution &ndash; written by someone else in 2004, last released in 2007, when Perl was in different shape and some tools didn&rsquo;t exist yet. <code>Bloom::Filter</code> is <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/XAERXESS">my third module I uploaded on CPAN</a>, but first managed by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker"><code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code></a> (EUMM). Previously I used <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla"><code>Dist::Zilla</code></a> (dzil) and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Milla"><code>Dist::Milla</code></a> (milla) to create a module from scratch and release it, which was quite overwhelming in case of <code>Dist:Zilla</code> (even with great documentation and <a href="http://dzil.org/">tutorial</a>), and very easy in case of <code>Dist::Milla</code>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>However, what should I do to make a realease of EUMM module was not very obvious to me. Despite I had read few blog posts and tutorials dealing with &ldquo;How to bootstrap release and manage a Perl module?&rdquo; topic, none of them actually <em>compared side by side and explained differences</em> between dzil, milla, EUMM and other tools such as <code>Module::Build</code>, <code>Module::Install</code>, <code>CPAN::Uploader</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. It was quite confusing for a newbie like me and I had to read documentation of each of these modules to find out if I needed that module or not. As it turned out, managing distribution created with EUMM is harder comparing to Dist::[ZM]illa, because one has to do many things manually. EUMM <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/ExtUtils::MakeMaker">documentation</a> says it&rsquo;s just <em>an utility designed to write a Makefile for an extension module from a Makefile.PL</em>. Bearing that in mind, next steps involved digging in EUMM documentation and hacking Makefile.PL. In particular, these are some problems I had to deal with (each of these should actually begin with &ldquo;Contrary to dzil / milla, &hellip;&rdquo;):</p>

<ul>
<li>To maintain compatibility with older EUMM version, I had to <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/Bloom-Filter/blob/1.1/Makefile.PL#L37">remove some features by hand in Makefile.PL</a>. I guess I expected that MakeMaker is actually MakeMakerMaker, which it isn&rsquo;t, obviously.</li>
<li>README and LICENCE were not autogenerated and I had to maintain cohesion between Makefile.PL and these files.</li>
<li>After doing <code>make dist</code> there&rsquo;s no next step to do actual release &ndash; tag, push and upload, another tool must be used for that (I used <code>CPAN::Uploader</code>).</li>
</ul>


<p>So I found out EUMM is not a distribution making swiss knife, just a tool for managing Makefile creation process. That said, I don&rsquo;t see a reason to use &ldquo;raw&rdquo; <code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code> or <code>Module::Build</code> plus some release tool instead of <code>Dist::Milla</code> &ndash; for my needs it&rsquo;s more than enough, it takes care of all boilercode <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t need to write, does all git-related release stuff, and changes version all over module.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Speaking of versioning &ndash; according to <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/">David Golden&rsquo;s article</a>, it should be a boring task. It wasn&rsquo;t, at least this time. I had to face two (actually three, third was, as always in Perl, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">TIMTOWTDI</a>) issues here:</p>

<ul>
<li>There was already <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/KJETIL/Bloom-Filter-1.1">1.1 release on BackPAN</a> (How is that possible?)</li>
<li><p>What is proper next development release for 1.0? I tried</p>

<pre><code>my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new('1.0');
$version-&gt;inc_alpha;
say $version;
</code></pre>

<p>which is unexpectedly <code>1_01</code>, not <code>1.0_01</code> but for <code>Perl::Version-&gt;new('1.1')</code> it&rsquo;s actually <code>1.1_01</code>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to just do one release for 1.1, without any dev releases. Luckilly, it worked without any problem, although it takes a while to <em>see</em> the release on (Meta)CPAN. Now, when this post is finished, I have to contact some downstream authors, which I know have been using <a href="http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/libbloom-filter-perl/1.0-3/1001_Use_Digest::SHA.patch">patched version of <code>Bloom::Filter</code></a> and point them to the new release.</p>

<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s this question which I am asking myself: should I move an old (i.e. co-maintained) module to <code>Dist::Milla</code>, or should it stay on EUMM forever?</p>

    <link href="https://xaerxess.pl/blog/2014/01/31/new-module-on-cpan-task-belike-xaerxess.html"/>
    <updated>2014-01-31T22:38:02+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://xaerxess.pl/blog/2014/01/31/new-module-on-cpan-task-belike-xaerxess</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/perlbrew">Perlbrew</a> is a great module. I use it on every machine &ndash; it lets me install modern Perl versions on systems which ship with ancient a.k.a. good-old perls like 5.8 or even those from previous millennium. But there comes a problem &ndash; every perlbrewed perl has a separate environment and it lacks all CPAN goodies you installed and used earlier. Plus, if you have few machines and / or like to experiment with various operating systems (like me), you have to install modules you use again and again.</p>

<p>To address this issue I&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Task-BeLike-XAERXESS"><code>Task::BeLike::XAERXESS</code></a>. It&rsquo;s a <a href="Task"><code>Task</code></a> module which has a simple purpose &ndash; it installs a module bundle <em>I</em> frequently use. What&rsquo;s more, because I uploaded it to <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, <em>you</em> can use install, try or modify it (the <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/Task-BeLike-XAERXESS">source code is on GitHub</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I don&rsquo;t expect that anyone besides me will ever install and use <code>Task::BeLike::XAERXESS</code>, but there was another reason I made this module: do a module release with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Milla"><code>Dist::Milla</code></a>. Let me cite:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>Milla</code> is a <code>Dist::Zilla</code> profile. It is a collection of <code>Dist::Zilla</code> plugin bundle, minting profile and a command line wrapper. It is designed around the &ldquo;Convention over Configuration&rdquo; philosophy (Opinionated), and by default doesn&rsquo;t rewrite module files nor requires you to change your workflow at all (Unobtrusive).</p></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to compare <code>milla</code> with pure <code>dzil</code> because I used latter once (to release my first module &ndash; <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::Duration::pl"><code>Time::Duration::pl</code></a>) and last few days there was <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2012/08/should-my-perl-release-process-be-yours.html">quite much buzz</a> about <code>Dist::Zilla</code> being <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2275/distzilla-haters-stop-your-whining/">suitable module releasing tool</a>. I&rsquo;ll write all my observations later in separate post, in just one sentence &ndash; <code>milla</code> is great: powerful like <code>dzil</code> but much simpler, it has everything <em>I</em> need to release a Perl module.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-27T00:04:43+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://xaerxess.pl/blog/2014/01/27/manifest-or-future-content-of-this-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting a programming blog (again). I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll be successful (where <em>successful</em> means <em>updated regularly</em> for me), but I&rsquo;d like to begin with meta-post about what I <em>want</em> to have here. Since I&rsquo;ve been (proffesionally) working as a <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, Java and JavaScript developer for few years, vast amount of topics will be about these programming languages, with Perl being main one.</p>

<p>Short clarification here: Perl has a facinating community with really, really great developers, and if you look back to previous sentence you&rsquo;ll see that I only linked to Perl webpage, contrary to Java and JavaScript. The reason is simple: <!-- more --> these two J* languages have no proper webpages and no <em>(open-source)</em> community. You can go to java.<strong>com</strong> and click big red download button, but that&rsquo;s all. Google &ldquo;java&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;Oracle&rdquo; and &ldquo;™&rdquo; higher than &ldquo;OpenJDK&rdquo;. Typing JavaScript in Google gives you <strong>zero</strong> language/community hits (let me just say that w3schools is first one); <a href="https://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a> is all about standards and many JS devs aren&rsquo;t be able to tell what ECMAScript is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, googling &ldquo;perl&rdquo; gives you hits like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Perl Programming Language &ndash; www.perl.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perl programming documentation &ndash; perldoc.perl.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network &ndash; www.cpan.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Strawberry Perl for Windows&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perl Monks&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Perl Foundation&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>from which <strong>every single resource is awesome</strong> &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve been using Perl for a while, you just can&rsquo;t <em>not</em> appreciate whole ecosystem and say <em>Perl is dead</em> because it&rsquo;s simply not true at all.</p>

<p>Besides writing about software engineering and programming languages, because I believe in free and open-source software and culture, I&rsquo;ll probably cover these topics, too. (Lately <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess">I started contributing</a> to various open-source projects, I&rsquo;ve been using GNU/Linux <a href="https://linuxcounter.net/user/407987.html">for almost nine years</a>, I really enjoy both). For now, I&rsquo;d like to point you to <a href="https://pjf.id.au/ethics/2013/12/28/do-not-stifle-innovation.html">this blog post</a> (by <a href="https://twitter.com/pjf">@pjf</a>) which I fully agree with:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While I’ve always known open source software is great, I’m increasingly starting to appreciate that open source developers are also great.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;d like to share everything on this site for free, so I&rsquo;m making all my code available under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a> (unless marked otherwise) and all my writing available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. You can grab the code of this blog is on <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/xaerxess.github.io">GitHub</a>, use it, fork it, modify it, etc. I&rsquo;ll also be grateful for all suggestions and for spelling or grammar fixes because blogging in English and not being native English speaker is a challenge.</p>

<p>Anyway, enjoy reading, consider leaving a comment or following me on some social media, and have a nice day.</p>

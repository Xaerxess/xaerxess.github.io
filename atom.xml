    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/perlbrew">Perlbrew</a> is a great module. I use it on every machine &ndash; it lets me install modern Perl versions on systems which ship with ancient a.k.a. good-old perls like 5.8 or even those from previous millennium. But there comes a problem &ndash; every perlbrewed perl has a separate environment and it lacks all CPAN goodies you installed and used earlier. Plus, if you have few machines and / or like to experiment with various operating systems (like me), you have to install modules you use again and again.</p>

<p>To address this issue I&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Task-BeLike-XAERXESS"><code>Task::BeLike::XAERXESS</code></a>. It&rsquo;s a <a href="Task"><code>Task</code></a> module which has a simple purpose &ndash; it installs a module bundle <em>I</em> frequently use. What&rsquo;s more, because I uploaded it to <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, <em>you</em> can use install, try or modify it (the <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/Task-BeLike-XAERXESS">source code is on GitHub</a>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I don&rsquo;t expect that anyone besides me will ever install and use <code>Task::BeLike::XAERXESS</code>, but there was another reason I made this module: do a module release with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Milla"><code>Dist::Milla</code></a>. Let me cite:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>Milla</code> is a <code>Dist::Zilla</code> profile. It is a collection of <code>Dist::Zilla</code> plugin bundle, minting profile and a command line wrapper. It is designed around the &ldquo;Convention over Configuration&rdquo; philosophy (Opinionated), and by default doesn&rsquo;t rewrite module files nor requires you to change your workflow at all (Unobtrusive).</p></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to compare <code>milla</code> with pure <code>dzil</code> because I used latter once (to release my first module &ndash; <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Time::Duration::pl"><code>Time::Duration::pl</code></a>) and last few days there was <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2012/08/should-my-perl-release-process-be-yours.html">quite much buzz</a> about <code>Dist::Zilla</code> being <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2275/distzilla-haters-stop-your-whining/">suitable module releasing tool</a>. I&rsquo;ll write all my observations later in separate post, in just one sentence &ndash; <code>milla</code> is great: powerful like <code>dzil</code> but much simpler, it has everything <em>I</em> need to release a Perl module.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m starting a programming blog (again). I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;ll be successful (where <em>successful</em> means <em>updated regularly</em> for me), but I&rsquo;d like to begin with meta-post about what I <em>want</em> to have here. Since I&rsquo;ve been (proffesionally) working as a <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, Java and JavaScript developer for few years, vast amount of topics will be about these programming languages, with Perl being main one.</p>

<p>Short clarification here: Perl has a facinating community with really, really great developers, and if you look back to previous sentence you&rsquo;ll see that I only linked to Perl webpage, contrary to Java and JavaScript. The reason is simple: <!-- more --> these two J* languages have no proper webpages and no <em>(open-source)</em> community. You can go to java.<strong>com</strong> and click big red download button, but that&rsquo;s all. Google &ldquo;java&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see &ldquo;Oracle&rdquo; and &ldquo;™&rdquo; higher than &ldquo;OpenJDK&rdquo;. Typing JavaScript in Google gives you <strong>zero</strong> language/community hits (let me just say that w3schools is first one); <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a> is all about standards and many JS devs aren&rsquo;t be able to tell what ECMAScript is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, googling &ldquo;perl&rdquo; gives you hits like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Perl Programming Language &ndash; www.perl.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perl programming documentation &ndash; perldoc.perl.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network &ndash; www.cpan.org&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Strawberry Perl for Windows&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perl Monks&rdquo;,</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Perl Foundation&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>from which <strong>every single resource is awesome</strong> &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve been using Perl for a while, you just can&rsquo;t <em>not</em> appreciate whole ecosystem and say <em>Perl is dead</em> because it&rsquo;s simply not true at all.</p>

<p>Besides writing about software engineering and programming languages, because I believe in free and open-source software and culture, I&rsquo;ll probably cover these topics, too. (Lately <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess">I started contributing</a> to various open-source projects, I&rsquo;ve been using GNU/Linux <a href="http://linuxcounter.net/user/407987.html">for almost nine years</a>, I really enjoy both). For now, I&rsquo;d like to point you to <a href="http://pjf.id.au/ethics/2013/12/28/do-not-stifle-innovation.html">this blog post</a> (by <a href="https://twitter.com/pjf">@pjf</a>) which I fully agree with:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While I’ve always known open source software is great, I’m increasingly starting to appreciate that open source developers are also great.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;d like to share everything on this site for free, so I&rsquo;m making all my code available under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a> (unless marked otherwise) and all my writing available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. You can grab the code of this blog is on <a href="https://github.com/Xaerxess/xaerxess.github.io">GitHub</a>, use it, fork it, modify it, etc. I&rsquo;ll also be grateful for all suggestions and for spelling or grammar fixes because blogging in English and not being native English speaker is a challenge.</p>

<p>Anyway, enjoy reading, consider leaving a comment or following me on some social media, and have a nice day.</p>

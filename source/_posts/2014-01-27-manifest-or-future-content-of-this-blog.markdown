I'm starting a programming blog (again). I don't know if it'll be successful (where _successful_ means _updated regularly_ for me), but I'd like to begin with meta-post about what I _want_ to have here. Since I've been (proffesionally) working as a [Perl](http://www.perl.org/), Java and JavaScript developer for few years, vast amount of topics will be about these programming languages, with Perl being main one.

Short clarification here: Perl has a facinating community with really, really great developers, and if you look back to previous sentence you'll see that I only linked to Perl webpage, contrary to Java and JavaScript. The reason is simple: <!-- more --> these two J* languages have no proper webpages and no _(open-source)_ community. You can go to java.**com** and click big red download button, but that's all. Google "java" and you'll see "Oracle" and "™" higher than "OpenJDK". Typing JavaScript in Google gives you **zero** language/community hits (let me just say that w3schools is first one); [ECMAScript](http://www.ecmascript.org/) is all about standards and many JS devs aren't be able to tell what ECMAScript is.

On the other hand, googling "perl" gives you hits like:

 - "The Perl Programming Language - www.perl.org",
 - "Perl programming documentation - perldoc.perl.org",
 - "The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network - www.cpan.org",
 - "Strawberry Perl for Windows",
 - "Perl Monks",
 - "The Perl Foundation"

from which **every single resource is awesome** - if you've been using Perl for a while, you just can't _not_ appreciate whole ecosystem and say _Perl is dead_ because it's simply not true at all.

Besides writing about software engineering and programming languages, because I believe in free and open-source software and culture, I'll probably cover these topics, too. (Lately [I started contributing](https://github.com/Xaerxess) to various open-source projects, I've been using GNU/Linux [for almost nine years](http://linuxcounter.net/user/407987.html), I really enjoy both). For now, I'd like to point you to [this blog post](http://pjf.id.au/ethics/2013/12/28/do-not-stifle-innovation.html) (by [@pjf](https://twitter.com/pjf)) which I fully agree with:

> "While I’ve always known open source software is great, I’m increasingly starting to appreciate that open source developers are also great."

What's more, I'd like to share everything on this site for free, so I'm making all my code available under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (unless marked otherwise) and all my writing available under [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). You can grab the code of this blog is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xaerxess/xaerxess.github.io), use it, fork it, modify it, etc. I'll also be grateful for all suggestions and for spelling or grammar fixes because blogging in English and not being native English speaker is a challenge.

Anyway, enjoy reading, consider leaving a comment or following me on some social media, and have a nice day.
